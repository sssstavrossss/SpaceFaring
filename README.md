Welcome to SpaceFaring.

A spaceport or cosmodrome is a site for launching (or receiving) spacecraft, by analogy to seaport for
ships or airport for aircraft. Our company associates with most of our Galaxyâ€™s cosmodromes and also
owns a variety of spacecrafts.
That being told, we are ready to please the space transportation needs of every individual regardless of
species. Our application targets on bringing together individuals who want to travel to infinity and
beyond.

This is a GroupProject developed for CB11 C# Coding Bootcamp.

Introduction
The app has two parts, one for the user and one for the administrator.
The user can see available flights for several planets. He can also see information about the planets and
different races. After he chooses a flight he can book flight seats and pay through paypal. When his
order is completed he can print the order. If he is a user, (is registered), he can add flights in his
favorites or see his older orders and tickets.
The administrator can make crud operations in the database through an administrator interface. He
can also see some statistics about the database. In order to see the administrators functionality, he
